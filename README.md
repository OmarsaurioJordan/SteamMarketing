# Godot Steam Capsules

Here you can drop your videogame's sprites in the Sprites folder, next, you can do the art you want in each of the capsule scenes, when run the tool, you can see each capsule and save it with Enter, and return with Escape, feel free to use this to do your art

I usually do my videogames with GMS, so I do this to create art with the videogame sprites and easy use of Godot 4.4 to publish on Steam and other platforms

Be sure that the folder contains an Sprites folder and Screenshoots folder, with that exact names
